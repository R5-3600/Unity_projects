 ~~ Source code for the Unity 2D game, My Summer Game (production ready) ~~
 
 The game is developed by yours truly, Ryzen5-3600.
 
 The game uses the Unity 2D engine of the latest stable 2022.2.6f1 release. For Windows and Linux builds, it uses the latest Visual Studio 2022 build. For MacOS and iOS builds, it uses the latest XCode 14.x.x

For Android builds, it uses the latest JDK 8 and SDK 32 (SDK 32 will be obtained in the Unity editor upon building), the JDK builds can be found here: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=436&field_architecture_target_id=391&field_java_package_target_id=396
 
 You just have to download the zip file then copy over the folder to another location and add the Unity project to the Unity Hub projects section. Once it is added, you can double click the project and Unity will set it up from there.
 
 The game is fully tested to work with Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android.
